##  Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+

```bash
cd patient-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` and use the navbar to navigate.

## 🧭 Try It Out (Interactive Walkthrough)

1) Navigate pages
- Click `Home`, `Patients`, and `About` in the header.

2) Search patients
- Go to `Patients` and type a name (e.g., `Leanne`, `Ervin`) in the search bar.
- Cards filter in real time.

3) View details in a modal
- Click `View Details` on any patient card.
- Close via the `×` button or press `Esc`.

4) Add a new patient
- Click `Add New Patient` on the Patients page.
- Fill the form and submit — a new card appears at the top.

5) Loading and error states
- The app shows a loading message during data fetch.
- To simulate an error, toggle your browser DevTools Network to `Offline` and reload; an error banner will appear.

## 💡 Features

- Responsive card/grid layout for patient list (Name, Age, Contact)
- Search by name with instant filtering
- Details modal with email, address, company
- Add New Patient with local state (no backend)
- Loading and error messaging for the fetch lifecycle

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- React Router (`react-router-dom`)
- CSS (no frameworks; easy to swap for Tailwind/Bootstrap if desired)

## 🌐 Data Source

- Uses `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` to fetch demo users.
- `age` is synthesized since the API doesn’t include it.

To point to a different source, update the `fetch` URL in `src/pages/Patients.jsx`.

## 🏗️ Build & Preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

- React Compiler is not enabled by default. See the official docs if you plan to enable it for production workflows.
